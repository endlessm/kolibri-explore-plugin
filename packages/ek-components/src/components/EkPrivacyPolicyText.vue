    <p><em>Last Revised: October 5th, 2022</em></p>
    <p>
      Welcome, and thank you for your interest in the Endless Key,
      whether accessed online, as an application on your personal
      device, or via USB disk (the “<b>Service</b>”). Endless Key is
      developed and published by Endless OS Foundation, a 501(c)(4) US
      non-profit organization, with the mission of helping school-aged
      students access great educational and learning resources without
      an internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Endless Key Privacy Policy (this “<b>Policy</b>”) describes
      the information that we gather from your usage of the Service,
      how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take
      to protect such information. Please read this Policy carefully
      before using our Service. By using the Service, you consent to
      our use of your information in accordance with the privacy
      practices described in this Policy.
    </p>
    <h5>General Statement</h5>

      mutual benefit of ourselves and the Endless OS Foundation
      mission, as well as our users. We make every effort to avoid
      collecting information closely associated with your personal
      identity. With respect to information tied to particular
      devices, we pseudonymize such information and use it solely to
      support our internal operations and improvement of the
      Services. We will never sell your data nor use it to market
      products or services to you.
    </p>

      the Service:

        Summary statistics regarding your access to and use of the
        Services, such as which educational content resources have
        been made available to you via the Service, and their
        popularity.
      </li>

            Key application instance and the device where it is
            running.

    <h5>How We Use Information</h5>
    <p>
      We may process the information collected from your use of the
      Services for carefully considered and specific purposes which
      are in our interests and enable us to enhance the services we

    </p>
    <ul>

        We use the information collected via the Service for Endless
        OS Foundation’s internal operations. This includes
        understanding and analyzing the usage trends and preferences
        of our users with the aim of increasing the educational value
        of the software and content, and monitoring our performance in
        order to issue enhancements to the user experience and
        functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may use the data to derive certain highly aggregated
        statistics and make them available to third parties or to the
        general public, for various purposes, including to demonstrate
        the impact of our software, as well as to convey our users’

        the Service. In particular, the Service utilizes the Kolibri
        platform developed by Learning Equality, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit

        Learning Equality or any other such third parties for the
        purposes permitted above.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may disclose your information if required to do so by law
        or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to
        comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright
        law), in response to a court order, judicial or other
        government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with
        law enforcement or other governmental agencies.
      </li>
      <li>
        We also reserve the right to disclose your information that we
        believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i)
        take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or
        others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity,
        (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party
        claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity
        of the Service and any facilities or equipment used to make
        the Service available, or (v) protect our property or other
        legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of
        our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Information collected via the Service may be disclosed and
        otherwise transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee
        as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of
        assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an
        insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information
        is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our
        business assets.
      </li>
      <li>
        We also may disclose your information in any other manner to
        which consent is provided directly from you, or where
        required, the responsible parent.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Third-Party Websites</h5>
    <p>
      The Service may contain features or links to websites and
      services provided by third parties. Any information you provide
      on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the
      operators of such services and is subject to those operators’
      policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if
      accessed through the Service. We are not responsible for the
      content or privacy and security practices and policies of
      third-party sites or services to which links or access are
      provided through the Website. We encourage you to learn about
      third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing
      them with information.
    </p>
    <h5>Data Security</h5>
    <p>
      We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards
      that are designed to improve the integrity and security of your
      personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure
      or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us,
      and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that
      such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
      destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or
      managerial safeguards.
    </p>
    <h5>Legal Bases for Use</h5>
    <p>
      The laws of some jurisdictions, including the European Economic
      Area and the United Kingdom, require that companies only process
      your “Personal Data” (as that term is defined in the applicable
      law, like the EU General Data Protection Regulation) if they
      have a “legal basis” (or justifiable need) for processing such
      Personal Data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal basis
      for processing Personal Data are the following legitimate
      interests:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Enabling us to conduct analytics of the Service in order to
        improve the Service, in particular improving the relevance of
        content selection for future use and users (e.g., by
        identifying what content is popular and unpopular);
      </li>
      <li>
        Producing high-level data aggregations and statistics that
        demonstrate the success of the Service and otherwise can be
        utilized in furtherance of our nonprofit mission, including by
        sharing such aggregate and statistical data with content
        partners and in fundraising activities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>International Visitors</h5>
    <p>
      Data collected via the Service is transmitted to our processing
      systems in the United States. If you choose to use the Service
      from other regions of the world with laws governing data
      collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please
      note that the data collected by the Service is transferred
      outside of those regions to the United States for storage and
      processing. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to
      other countries or regions in connection with storage and
      processing of data, and fulfilling your requests.
    </p>
    <h5>Modifications</h5>
    <p>
      This Policy may be updated or modified at any time to reflect
      changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the
      features of our Services or advances in technology.  The current
      Policy will be made accessible through use of the Services with
      an updated “Last Revised” date. In the event of any material
      changes to this Policy, we will endeavor to notify our users to
      the extent possible, including by posting a notice relating
      thereto on the Service. Schools and school districts that have
      formally notified us of their use of the Service will also
      receive email notification of such changes.
